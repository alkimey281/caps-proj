# Featured cemeteries

The cemeteries featured in this project forever tie African-American citizens to the land of the southern United States. Land they were forced to work on, creating the wealth and infrastructure of this country. After 1865 they built communities on these lands as freed men and women only to have that land taken from them again and again. Today, many of the descendents of these freed men and women are unaware of the location of their ancestors' burial sites or are denied access to them. This page seeks to provide as much information on the cemeteries featured in this project so that these spaces will be protected from development, their residents identified, their history preserved, and made accessible to their living descendents. There is so much life in these cemeteries and so many stories to be told. Here are some of them.
